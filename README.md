# Bloc-Project

This was a project for my internship,
it was my first time learning MERN STACK.



#Installation

go first to 'cd api', then go change the link of mongodb with urs, (the one in the code doesn't work anymore ;) )
then run the command 'npm i ' to install all dependencies required :D.

after u done go to client folder 'cd client'
and run the command 'npm i' to install all dependencies required :D.

#Launch the website :

first run the api: 'nodemon run'
then run the client file : 'npm start'

#ENJOY ;)
